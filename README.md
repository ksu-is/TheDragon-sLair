#A text based dungeons and dragon's campain

#random number generator added along with a print test to test if it is working

#added a text based image for the monster fight
#replaced the "sorry, you died." text with a YOU DIED text image

#next step is to find a way to get the fight outcome to be based on the D20 dice roll

#diceRoll has been added to determine the outcome of the monster fight.

#rolls a number between 1 - 20, a number >= 10 results in a successful outcome

#the else part of the diceRoll if statement results in losing the fight and breaks the loop forcing one the have to reinitiate the dungeon
